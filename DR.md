    SLIDE: SACKED
1. 15 months ago, I was one of 7 people laid off from a successful startup. We weren't expectng this reoorg, and we were all stunned. But I set out early on to make the layoff a learning experience. And I didn't do this alone. 

    SRE for your CAREER

2. At other DevOpsDays I proposed openspaces on what I now call "SRE for your Career" and soaked up great ideas on Reliability Engineering for the "uptime" in your career. And for the first part of this talk I got advisory panel input from an HR specialist, a VP of Engineering, and a CEO-Founder.

3. Reliability engineering assumes failure is inevitable. For modern careers, as with modern technology systems, the key metric in the face of failure is not mean-time-between-failures, MTBF, but mean-time-to-recovery, MTTR.

4. ?With technical job tenure declining, do you need to prepare for failure, for job loss? Well, if you have job: YES, prep for failure. So lets map DevOps and SRE practices for before, during and after an "Incident":


  SLIDE: (Complex Map)
 5. My advisory panel approved this mapping: But. But when I stepped back, and put on my systems thinking hat, I saw two glaring holes that were outside an individual's control.  One: Denial of Service attacks (AKA non-compete clauses) and

6. Single points of failure. First: Non-competes, a talk unto itself. Suffice to say these employment restrictions are growing to the detriment of tech workers and others. Note that California forbids them, and the evidence is they hinder broader economic growth. So lets get rid of them!


  SLIDE: Plutocrat
7. Second: Single points of failure: Namely You. You in relationship to your employer are a single point of failure.  Folks I've talked to believe their employer cares about them. To be fair: Your boss, even your CEO, may care about you. But your employer as a corporate entity does not. Unconvinced? Consider these questions:

  SLIDE: Noncompete? OnCall? Training? Unlimited PTO
8.  Have you been subject to non-competes: or the "denial-of-employment" attack. How about on call rotation without a bump in pay? Been shorted on training? Or subjected to "unlimited PTO" which results in less vacation AND less pay?

  SLIDE: Compensation, Harassment, Severance
9. Are you confident your compensation is fair? Confident that in harassment cases HR would have your back? Confident that if you get pink-slipped you could get back on your feet with your severance package?  Meanwhile, these headlines:

10, 11..  Now look, Tech  workers may consider themselves elite. But at DevOpsDays Baltimore I spoke on "The Importance of Being Average" That is on average, you are average; if you're not management now, you won't be soon. So keep the employee perspective.


What to do about this mismatch between employer power and employee voiceless; and how it inhibits growth, drives good people out, and subjects us all to bad press? One possible antidote: the folks who brought you the 40-hour work week (31s)


   SLIDE: A Union
12. Unions. Yep. Unions. Are you dismssing this notion? That unions are 1970s? That they're anti-competitive? If so, ask yourself if you're engaging in lazy thinking. Lazy thinking you wouldn't tolerate in a technical discussion

13. of an implementation vs the technology. Like dismissing PHP as insecure, or JVM apps as buggy & bloated, simply because someone can cite old examples of bad apps, irrelevant to the core tech. Likewise, unions have changed a lot, a lot, in the last 10-20 years.

14. Professional union membership has been growing, in part because we're seeing new models emerging, a "minimum viable union" to provide a seat at the table with a leaner implementation. This includes unions at new media outfits,

15. where workers recognize competitiveness is vital. So layoffs can address a content or editorial pivot, and the contract emphasized pay for performance (over seniority), guarantees transparency, a grievance process, and severance benefit; The grievance process in particular

    SLIDE: 19¢ v 10¢
17. with unions, the gap closes to 10 cents on the dollar. Likewise for minorities; pay gaps narrow with unions. Unions can enhance performance. Fewer people die when health care worker organize - thanks to better reporting and working conditions. So you can run an **experiment**

pause]Remember, A union is YOU. You, not an outside entity. National affiliates provide resources, but it's you and your colleagues who are given a voice.

19. Let me drill 3 points home. One: Practice SRE for your career. All your wisdom can be applied to your most important product: You. Two: Our profession should eliminate DDOS attacks by refusing non-competes. Ask about them before an interview, and if a prospect uses them, take a pass.  (20s)


    SLIDE: Taking a Bow
20. Three: Don't bow out of opportunites for giving employees a voice. A more competitive, productive and HUMANANE workplace is possible. Assess reality, not myths, if a colleague brings up unionizing. And on that, I'll take my own bow - Thank you so much! (16s)

 

21. This is not sour grapes. In a union scenario I would have still been laid off to reflect changing priorities at that company, but I would have known that all of us laid-off had severance packages that were equitable and sufficient.
