    SLIDE: SACKED
1. 15 months ago, I was one of 7 people laid off from a successful startup. We weren't expectng the reoorg, and were all stunned. But I set out early on to make the layoff a learning experience. And I got a lot of help (13s)

2. At DevOpsDays I proposed "DR for your Career" openspaces and heard great ideas on Reliability Engineering for the "uptime" in your career. And this advisory panel, helped with my Devops to Career mapping.

3. Now Reliability engineering assumes failure happens. For modern careers, as with modern technology systems, the key metric in the face of failure is not mean-time-between-failures, but mean-time-to-recovery. (14)

4. With technical job tenure declining, with an industry in flux, you should prepare for employment mean-time-to recovery as you would for system outages. And you can map SRE & DevOps practice to your career as shown here:

  SLIDE: (Complex Map)
 5. (2s pause) After running this by my panel, I stepped back to consider the SYSTEM, and saw two gaps where we have little control: (one) single points of failure. and (two) denial of Service attacks,

  SLIDE: Failure here may mean death below
6. Gap one: Single point of failure:  You. You are a single-point of failure in your employment arrangement. You negotiate alone, you navigate the system alone, you are laidoff alone. Folks at our openspaces thought their **employer** (14s)

  SLIDE: Plutocrat
7. cared for them, and that they owed the company loyalty. To be fair: Your boss, even your CEO, may care about you.  But the corporate entity does not care, and is not loyal to you. Unconvinced? Consider these questions:


  SLIDE: Noncompete? OnCall? Training? Unlimited PTO
8.  Have you been subject to non-competes?  How about on call rotation without a bump in pay? Been shorted on training? Or subjected to "unlimited PTO" which usually mean less vacation AND less pay?

  SLIDE: Compensation, Harassment, Severance
9. Are you confident your compensation is fair? Confident that in harassment cases HR would have your back? Confident that if you get pink-slipped you could get back on your feet with your severance package?  Meanwhile, these headlines:

  SLIDE: HEADLINES
10.  (2s pause) At DevOpsDays Baltimore I spoke on "The Importance of Being Average" and thinking statistically about yourself. On average, if you're not management now, you won't be soon. So keep the employee perspective, then:


  SLIDE: Bezos: I don't recognize this Amazon
11. What to do about this mismatch between employer power and employee voiceless; and how it drives drives burnout, results in  bad press, pushes out good people? Consider: the folks who brought us the 40-hour work week.


   SLIDE: A Union
12. Unions. Yep. Unions. Are you dismssing this notion? That unions are 1970s? That they're anti-competitive? If so, ask yourself if you're thinking critically. You wouldn't tolerate lazy thinking conflating a **technology**

   SLIDE: IBM computer
13. with particular implementations. That's like dismissing PHP as insecure, or Perl as unreadable, just because someone can cite ancient examples, irrelevant to the core tech. Likewise, unions have changed a lot in the last decades.

14. Professional union membership is growing and  new models are emerging; a "minimum viable union" to provide a seat at the table with a leaner implementation. This includes unions at new media outfits, 

    SLIDE: w: Gawker, Fusion, HuffPost, The Root, Salon, Vice, MTV News, Think Progress, Thrillist
15. where workers know competitiveness is key. When a corporate Pivot is needed, LayOffs happen so contracts stress pay for performance, grievance processes, and severance benefits. And remember: A union is YOU. It's your **voice**,
 

    SLIDE: Switchboard operators
16. not an outside entity. National affiliates provide resources, but it's you and your colleagues who are given a say. That say benefits women and minorities. While the gender pay gap is 19 cents on the dollar nationally, unions


    SLIDE: 19¢ v 10¢
17. narrow that to 10¢. So Unions address the single-point-of-failure gap. The denial-of-service gap? Non-compete clauses. Noncompetes are bad for tech workers and the innovation economy. So, consider 2 **experiments**:

    SLIDE: Tinkerer / Fidget Spinner

18. One: Refuse non-competes when applying. Ask early on, and then move on if necessary. Or Two. Consider the single-issue "PopUp" union, as EMC workers did, organizing to lift their non-compete clauses in 2016.

    SLIDE: Wartime AssemblyWomen
19. Let me drill 3 points home. One: Practice SRE for your career. Your wisdom works for you, your most importatn product. Two: Let's elimate non-competes. Either pass on companies that use them, or organize at your workplace.


    SLIDE: Taking a Bow
20. Three: Don't bow out of giving employees a voice. A more competitive, productive and HUMANANE workplace is possible. Assess reality, not myths, if a colleague brings up unionizing. And on that, I'll take my own bow - Thank you so much! (16s)


21. This is not sour grapes. In a union scenario I would have still been laid off to reflect changing priorities at that company, but I would have known that all of us laid-off had severance packages that were equitable and sufficient.


First: Denial of Service Attacks, which I map to NonCompete clauses - as Denial of Employment attacks. Let's put an end to them! Noncompetes are bad for tech workers and the economy. California doesn't need 'em, either do we. (16s
