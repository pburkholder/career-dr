1. Sacked. Yes, 15 months ago I, along with 7 colleagues in the “Customer Success” division of Chef Software, were let go. Although stunned by this turn of events, I decided early on to make the layoff a learning experience.

2. Advisory panel: I didn’t do this alone. At two other DevOpsDays I facilitated open spaces on “DR for your Career” and got some great ideas for how to map our technical best practices to the "uptime" for our own careers. Also, I’ve run these proposals past an advisory panel comprising an HR specialist, a Director of Engineering, and a CEO/founder of multiple start-ups.

4. Let’s apply DevOps and Disaster Recovery preparedness to our own careers, starting with a core metric: Uptime. Traditionally, in operations and in our careers, we focussed on mean-time-between-failures (MTBF). But in a world of continuous delivery/DevOps, the better metric is mean-time-to recovery (MTTR). Do you need DR prep? Here's a simple decision tree: Do you have a job? If yes, then you're a risk for losing it.technical fields. Consider it inevitable that you’ll need to change jobs, either because you initiate that, or because you’re employer does. As with DR, one you don’t test your restore from backup after the site goes down, but before. So most of our DR prep happens while you’re still employed. Key points:

5. However with 5 minutes to work with, and just great feedback from my Advisory Panel, any sensible mapping from DevOps best practices
to career best practices just became a jumble of words that I couldn't do justice to. Further, so much of what'd suggested at our OpenSpaces and the Arrested DevOps episode didn't address the most important resilence / HA principle of all:

6. SPOF and Horizontal Scaling: Everything we discussed so far is about you, as single working unit. That makes you a single-point of failure, as it were. How do we introduce redundancy, or enabling scaling, into this system? By employee organizing -- and here we go into content _not_ endorsed by my advisory panel....

7. Your employer doesn't care about you. In the openspaces I've held I've been suprised how many people think their employer cares about them. Note that your boss may care about your, and even your CEO may try her best care about you. But your employer is the corporate entity: driven by investors, shareholders, boards, and when the chips are down, it does not care about you.

A corrective: employee organizing / collective action. There's a name for the folks who brought you the weekend & the 40-hour work week:

12. So, on the one hand there's this mistaken notion that our employing entities care about us, and on the other there's a lot of mistaken notions about unions. In fact, I'd guess many of you are about to dismiss this unions out of hand. If so, ask yourself if your engaging in lazy thinking. Lazy thinking you wouldn't tolerate in technical discussion like

13. Do you hold the same opinions on topics like language choice, software delivery, and infrastructure automation as you did 15 years ago? I hope not. And as As with employee organzing, they're topics that are broad & deep, that vary greatly in their implementation, and that have changed a lot, a lot, in the last 10-20 years. So let's take a fresh look.

19. Let me drill 3 points home. One: Practice SRE for your career. All your wisdom can be applied to your most important product: You. Two: Our profession should eliminate DDOS attacks by refusing non-competes. Ask, before an interview, and if a prospect uses them, take a pass.  (20s)

20. Three: Don't bow out of opportunites for giving employees a voice. A more competitive, productive workplace is possible. Assess reality, not myths, if a union comes knocking. And on that note, I'll take my own bow - Thank you so much for your time & attention. (16s)
