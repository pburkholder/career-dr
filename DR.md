1. Sacked. Yes, 15 months ago I, along with 7 colleagues in the “Customer Success” division of Chef Software, were let go. Although surprised by this turn of events, I decide to make the layoff a learning experience.

2. Advisory panel: I didn’t do this alone. At two other DevOpsDays we had open spaces on “DR for your Career” and got great idea. Also, to ground truth, I’ve run these proposals past an advisory panel comprising an HR specialist, a Director of Engineering, and a CEO/founder of multiple start-ups.

3. MTTR: Let’s apply DevOps principles of Disaster Recovery preparedness to tend to our own careers, starting with a core metric: Uptime. In the past, we focussed in mean-time-between-failures. But in a world of continuous delivery, the better metric is mean-time-to recovery.

4. DR Prep: This decade we’ve seen a decline in median tenure in technical fields. Consider it inevitable that you’ll need to change jobs, either because you initiate that, or because you’re employer does. As with DR, one you don’t test your restore from backup after the site goes down, but before. So most of our DR prep happens while you’re still employed. Key points:

5. Metrics/Monitoring: It's hard to know how you're doing or where you stand. Humans are bad at gathering feedback, hearing it and learning from it. My recommendation: the first few chapters of "Thanks for the Feedback" by Stone & Heen.

6. Logs & Offsite Backups: Get commitments in writing, or pull a Robert Mueller and write memos of key conversations. Document your contributions and their _impact_ such money saved or opportunities enabled. This is your offsite backup of your accomplishments.

7. Redundancy/Minimize Attack Surface: Write references for colleagues on LinkedIn. 1. They'll ponder your contributions, 2. It'll demonstrate to future employers you engage in production Give & Take.  Speaking of social media: Minimize your attack surface. Don't talk smack on Twitter unless you can take the consequences.

8. Continuous Delivery & Embrace Open-source: You are own product: Learn. Experiment. Make small failures and correct. Admit ignorance daily.  And participate in OpenSource: Even if you can't use GitHub at work. Comment on issues and improve documentation. It'll be noticed.

9. Game Day: Any DR plan needs testing. Update your resume yearly.  Practice job hunting and interviewing. Don't waste anyone's time, but you can say: "I'm happy with my job, but I'm interested in your post. Can we take 20 minutes to talk about it?".  But what to do if you are sacked? As with DevOps, Practice CALMs:

10. CALMS:
    Calm
    Ask questions
    Lawyer up
    Mull it over
    Severance

    First: try to stay calm. An Oscar-worthy outburst may seem satisfying, but could jeopardize any further negotiaions. Ask questions, don't rush, take all morning. Legal advice is in order, and a bargain relative to mistakes you might make. Mull things over: don't sign anything. Say you feel under duress. You're legally ok. And Severance is a negotitiation, not a gift. 

11. Incident response:
	- Designate an incident commander
		○ Maybe not your spouse or partner
		○ Don't make precipitous decisions
		○ And if you know someone who's been canned: Offer to help!
	- Forensics
		○ Keep all relevant documentation

12. Recovery:
