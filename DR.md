    SLIDE: SACKED
1. Sacked. Yes, 15 months ago I, along with 7 colleagues in the “Customer Success” division of Chef Software, were let go. Although stunned by this turn of events, I decided early on to make the layoff a learning experience.

2. Advisory panel: I didn’t do this alone. At two other DevOpsDays I facilitated open spaces on “DR for your Career” and got some great ideas for how to map our technical best practices to the "uptime" for our own careers. Also, I’ve run these proposals past an advisory panel comprising an HR specialist, a Director of Engineering, and a CEO/founder of multiple start-ups.

4. Let’s apply DevOps and Disaster Recovery preparedness to our own careers, starting with a core metric: Uptime. Traditionally, in operations and in our careers, we focussed on mean-time-between-failures (MTBF). But in a world of continuous delivery/DevOps, the better metric is mean-time-to recovery (MTTR). Do you need DR prep? Here's a simple decision tree: Do you have a job? If yes, then you're a risk for losing it.technical fields. Consider it inevitable that you’ll need to change jobs, either because you initiate that, or because you’re employer does. As with DR, one you don’t test your restore from backup after the site goes down, but before. So most of our DR prep happens while you’re still employed. Key points:

  SLIDE: (Complex Map)
 5. I can map all of the SRE practices of the left with matching career practices. But when I stepped back and looked at the entire system, I saw two glaring holes that were outside an individual's contol.  One: Denial of Service attacks (or, the use of Non-Compete by employers) and 

  SLIDE: Failure here may mean death below
6. Single points of failure. First: Non-competes.... These employment restrictions are proliferating to the detriment of tech workers and others. Note that California forbid them, and the evidence is they hinder economic growth. So lets get rid of them!


  SLIDE: Plutocrat
7. Second: Single points of failure: Namely You. You in relationship to your employer are a single point of failure.  Folks I've talked to believe their employer cares about them. To be fair: Your boss, even your CEO, may care about you. But your employer as an entity does not. Unconvinced? Consider these questions:

  SLIDE: Noncompete? OnCall? Training? Unlimited PTO
8.  Non-competes: aka denial-of-employment attack. Been asked to do on call - without any pay bump? Been shorted on training? Or subject to "unlimited PTO" which results in less vacation AND less pay?

  SLIDE: Compensation, Harassment, Severance
9. Or no to any of these?..... So you're on your own and meanwhile...


  SLIDE: HEADLINES
  SLIDE: Bezos: I don't recognize this Amazon
10, 11..  Meanwhile, these headline: Tech sector employees & fans of Silicon Valley may consider themselves elite. But at DevOpsDays Baltimore I talked about being statistical in evaluting yourself. And if you're not management now, you won't be  soon. On average, you are average. So this mismatch between employer power and employee voiceless is to the detriment of fast-growing companies as their wracked with scandal, mismanagement and bad press.  One possible antidote: the folks who brought you the weekend & the 40-hour work week (31s)


   SLIDE: A Union
12. Unions. Yep. Unions. Are you dismssing this notion? That unions are 1970s? That they're anti-competitive? If so, ask yourself if your engaging in lazy thinking. Lazy thinking you wouldn't tolerate in technical discussion like

13. Do you hold the same opinions on topics like language choice, software delivery, and infrastructure automation as you did 15 years ago? I hope not. And as As with employee organzing, they're topics that are broad & deep, that vary greatly in their implementation, and that have changed a lot, a lot, in the last 10-20 years. So let's take a fresh look.

19. Let me drill 3 points home. One: Practice SRE for your career. All your wisdom can be applied to your most important product: You. Two: Our profession should eliminate DDOS attacks by refusing non-competes. Ask, before an interview, and if a prospect uses them, take a pass.  (20s)

20. Three: Don't bow out of opportunites for giving employees a voice. A more competitive, productive workplace is possible. Assess reality, not myths, if a union comes knocking. And on that, I'll take my own bow - Thank you so much for your time & attention. (16s)
