1. Sacked. Yes, 15 months ago I, along with 7 colleagues in the “Customer Success” division of Chef Software, were let go. Although surprised by this turn of events, I decide to make the layoff a learning experience.

2. Advisory panel: I didn’t do this alone. At two other DevOpsDays we had open spaces on “DR for your Career” and got great idea. Also, to ground truth, I’ve run these proposals past an advisory panel comprising an HR specialist, a Director of Engineering, and a CEO/founder of multiple start-ups.

3. MTTR: Let’s apply DevOps principles of Disaster Recovery preparedness to tend to our own careers, starting with a core metric: Uptime. In the past, we focussed in mean-time-between-failures. But in a world of continuous delivery, the better metric is mean-time-to recovery.

4. DR Prep: This decade we’ve seen a decline in median tenure in technical fields. Consider it inevitable that you’ll need to change jobs, either because you initiate that, or because you’re employer does. As with DR, one you don’t test your restore from backup after the site goes down, but before. So most of our DR prep happens while you’re still employed. Key points:

5. Metrics/Monitoring: It's hard to know how you're doing or where you stand. Humans are bad at gathering feedback, hearing it and learning from it. One standout: the first few chapters of "Thanks for the Feedback" by Stone & Heen.

6. Logs & Offsite Backups: Get commitments in writing, or pull a Mueller and write memos of key conversations. Document your contributions and their _impact_ such money saved or opportunities enabled. This is your offsite backup of your accomplishments.

7. Redundancy/Minimize Attack Surface: Write references for colleagues on LinkedIn. 1. They'll ponder your contributions, 2. It'll demonstrate to future employers you engage in production Give & Take.  Speaking of social media: Minimize your attack surface. Don't talk smack on Twitter unless you can take the consequences.

8. Avoid Vendor LockIn / Embrace OpenSource
		○ Contribute to GitHub: 
		○ Practice learning
		○ Admit ignorance
	- Drill/GameDays
		○ Leverage your performance review - do it quarterly
		○ Apply for jobs


Incident response:
	When Fired: Know how to react when fail happens 
	- Calms: not CALMS, just don't make a bad situation worse
		○ Calm
		○ Ask
		○ Learn
		○ MMM????
		○ Severance
	- Designate an incident commander
		○ Maybe not your spouse or partner
		○ Don't make precipitous decisions
		○ And if you know someone who's been canned: Offer to help!
	- Forensics

Recovery
	- Route around network failures
		○ Use all your networks to find a new position
			§ Getting a new one relies on your backup networks 
			§ Don't put all your DNS servers on the same subnet
		○ Find other people looking for work and commiserate/support each other. 
			§ This has been hard for me. I felt like a failure and didn't want to be associated with other failures.

There's a whole class of career failure modes I've not discussed:
	- Eliminate SPOFS
	- Embrace horizontal scaling
	- Avoid monolithic architectures
	- Mitigate against potential DDOS
And since what I have to say my put me in jeopardy with future potential employers, if you are a hiring manager or in HR, I'd like to introduce you to my fidget spinner. Look. Ohhhhhh. Now just keep watching that, and the rest of you line employees follow what I say:

Your employer doesn't care about you. Your boss may try to, your CEO may try to, but even if they are well-intended they are subject to external forces: shareholders or a board.  This may be true even for you. Consider if you've been subject to any of the following:

- ever signed an Noncompete? 
- ever carried a pager been on call without at least a 7% raise? 
- ever wondered if your compensation is fair compared to your peers 
- ever wondered if you were harassed, whether HR side with your harasser instead of you? 
- ever wondered, if you were laid off, would your severance suffice to cover you until your next job? 
Has your employer invested in your career and training?
