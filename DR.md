 SLIDE: SACKED

 1. 15 months ago, I was one of 7 people laid off from a successful startup. We weren't expectng the reoorg, and were all stunned. But I set out early on to make the layoff a learning experience. And I got a lot of help (13s)

 SLIDE: THANKS

 2. from DevOpsDays where I proposed "DR for your Career" openspaces and heard strong ideas on Reliability Engineering for the "uptime" in your career. And this advisory panel, helped tune my Devops to Career mapping.

 SLIDE: MTTR

 3. Now Reliability engineering assumes failure happens. For modern careers, as with modern technology systems, the key metric in the face of failure is not mean-time-between-failures, but mean-time-to-recovery. (14)

 SLIDE: Tenure

 4. With technical job tenure declining, with an industry in flux, you should prepare for employment mean-time-to recovery as you would for system outages. And you can map SRE & DevOps practice to your career as shown here:

 SLIDE: MAP

 5. (2s pause) After running this by my panel, I stepped back to consider the SYSTEM, and saw two gaps where we have little control: (one) single points of failure. and (two) denial of Service attacks,

 SLIDE: Failure 

 6. Gap one: Single point of failure:  You. You are a single-point of failure in your employment arrangement. You negotiate alone, you navigate the system alone, you are laidoff alone. Folks at our openspaces thought their **employer** (14s)

 SLIDE: Plutocrat

 7. cared for them, and that they owed the company loyalty. To be fair: Your boss, even your CEO, may care about you.  But the corporate entity does not care, and is not loyal to you. Unconvinced? Consider these questions:

 SLIDE: Noncompete

 8. Have you been subject to non-competes?  How about on call  without a bump in pay? Been shorted on training? Or subjected to "unlimited PTO" which usually mean less vacation AND less pay?

 SLIDE: Compensation

 9. Are you confident your compensation is fair? Confident that in harassment cases HR would have your back? Confident that if you get pink-slipped you could get back on your feet with your severance package?  Meanwhile, these headlines:

 SLIDE: HEADLINES

 10. (2s pause) At DevOpsDays Baltimore I spoke on "The Importance of Being Average" and statistical thinking about yourself. On average, unless you're management now, you won't be soon. So lets keep the employee perspective.

 SLIDE: Bezos**

 11. Then what about this mismatch between employer power and employee voiceless, and how it drives burnout, generates bad press, pushes out good people? Consider: the folks who brought us the 40-hour work week.

 SLIDE: walgreen

 12. Yep. Unions. Are you dismssing this notion? That unions are 1970s? Or anti-competitive? If so, consider if you're thinking critically. You shouldn't tolerate conflating a **technology**

 SLIDE: IBM 

 13. with its implementations. Like dismissing PHP as  insecure, or Perl as unreadable, just because someone can cite ancient but irrelevant examples. Likewise, today's unions are not yesterday's

 SLIDE: Prof_union

 14. Professional union membership is growing and new models are emerging; the "minimum viable union" to get a seat at the table with a leaner structure. This includes unions at new media companies,

 SLIDE: Gawker

 15. where workers know agility matters. When the company pivots, layOffs happen. So, contracts stress pay for performance, the grievance process, and severance benefits. And remember: A union is YOU. It's your **voice**,

 SLIDE: Switchboard

 16. not an outside body. National unions provide support, but you and your colleagues have the say. And That voice, it protects women and minorities. While the U.S. gender pay gap is 19 cents on the dollar, unions

 SLIDE: 19Â¢

 17. narrow that to 10 cents. So Unions address single-points-of-failure. The denial-of-service gap? Non-compete clauses. Noncompetes are bad for tech workers and the tech economy. So, consider 2 **experiments**:

 SLIDE: Tinkerer
 18. One: When applying ask about non-competes early, then pass if need be. Two: Consider the "PopUp" union. Last year EMC workers organized around one-issue: to end their non-competes. So let me **drill** 

 SLIDE: Wartime

 19. Three points home. One: Practice SRE for your career. That wisdom works for you, your most important product. Two: Let's end non-competes. Either pass on companies that use them, or organize to end them.

 SLIDE: Bow

 20. Three: Don't bow out of giving employees a voice. A more competitive, productive and HUMANANE workplace is possible. Assess reality, not myths, when organizing comes up. And on that, I'll take my own bow - Thank you so much! jjj(16s)
