## Checklist of major points to make:

_ Personally, I would want to have been laid off. This is not sour grapes. In a union scenario I would have still been laid off to reflect changing priorities at that company, but I would have known that all of us laid-off had severance packages that were equitable and sufficient.


_ Emphasize performance over seniority
_ Improve competitiveness
_ Enhance diversity
_ You aren't management. Keep employee perspective. Unions are for people like you.
_ A Union is YOU. It's not an outside entity. A national affiliation provides resources, but it's you and your colleagues who are given a voice. As with an MVP; you can run an experiment
_ Suggest people photograph the mapping slide (skip)
_ Like life insurance, don't wait until you're sick (skip)
_ Lots of FUD. (skip)
_ Aren't expensive (skip)
_ Unions akin to TDD (skip)

And since what I have to say my put me in jeopardy with future potential employers, if you are a hiring manager or in HR, I'd like to introduce you to my fidget spinner. Look. Ohhhhhh. Now just keep watching that, and the rest of you line employees follow what I say:

SLIDE: minimum viable union
SLIDE: test-driven (employee) development
SLIDE: Not your grandmother's/grandfather's union

What I've discovered is a lot of uninformed but strongly held opinions. And FUD, Fear/Uncertainty/Doubt, worthy of 1980s-era IBM disinformation campaign.

SLIDE: competitiveness
- Personally, I would want a union that maintained the ability to re-org employees in response to market changes, and to shed dead weight. 

Rants: Unions are anti-capitalist: No they're just a market force countervailing the collusion between industrialists.

TALK with AFGE on Friday!! - Done
