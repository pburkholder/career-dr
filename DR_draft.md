 Points not yet incorporated:

Incident response:
	When Fired: Know how to react when fail happens 
	- Calms: not CALMS, just don't make a bad situation worse
		○ Calm
		○ Ask
		○ Legal advice
		○ Mull it over
		○ Severance
	- Designate an incident commander
		○ Maybe not your spouse or partner
		○ Don't make precipitous decisions
		○ And if you know someone who's been canned: Offer to help!
	- Forensics

Recovery
	- Route around network failures
		○ Use all your networks to find a new position
			§ Getting a new one relies on your backup networks 
			§ Don't put all your DNS servers on the same subnet
		○ Find other people looking for work and commiserate/support each other. 
			§ This has been hard for me. I felt like a failure and didn't want to be associated with other failures.

There's a whole class of career failure modes I've not discussed:
	- Eliminate SPOFS
	- Embrace horizontal scaling
	- Avoid monolithic architectures
	- Mitigate against potential DDOS
And since what I have to say my put me in jeopardy with future potential employers, if you are a hiring manager or in HR, I'd like to introduce you to my fidget spinner. Look. Ohhhhhh. Now just keep watching that, and the rest of you line employees follow what I say:

Your employer doesn't care about you. Your boss may try to, your CEO may try to, but even if they are well-intended they are subject to external forces: shareholders or a board.  This may be true even for you. Consider if you've been subject to any of the following:

- ever signed an Noncompete? 
- ever been assigned uncompensated on-call duty? After-hours maintenance?
- ever gone a year without attending a confernce, course or other training?
- ever been subjected to "Unlimited PTO"?

- Are you confident your compensation is fair compared to your peers 
- Are you confident if you were harassed, you employer would support your claim? 
- Are you confident if you were laid off, would your severance would cover you until your next job? 


SLIDE: minimum viable union
SLIDE: test-driven (employee) development
SLIDE: Not your grandmother's/grandfather's union
- If you dismiss unions out of hand, then you may be engaging in lazy thinking. Lazy thinking you wouldn't tolerate if one judged today's technology by their incarnation 25 years ago: Linux in the datacenter: Nonsense! Daily software releases: Dangerous!

SLIDE: competitiveness
- Personally, I would want a union that maintained the ability to re-org employees in response to market changes, and to shed dead weight. 

Rants: "right-to-work laws" should be compensated by right to clawback CXO golden parachutes.

Rants: Unions are anti-capitalist: No their just a market force countervailing the collusion between industrialists.
