## Closing points:

Let's focus on a few things:
- The best practices of DevOps for site & application availability also apply to maintaining your own availibilty
- Now, when you think you need a voice for employees in your org, and someone talks to you about collective bargaining, listen
- And, to demonstrate that we have market impact: let's stamp out non-compete agreements.

There's a whole class of career failure modes I've not discussed:
	- Eliminate SPOFS
	- Embrace horizontal scaling
	- Avoid monolithic architectures
	- Mitigate against potential DDOS
And since what I have to say my put me in jeopardy with future potential employers, if you are a hiring manager or in HR, I'd like to introduce you to my fidget spinner. Look. Ohhhhhh. Now just keep watching that, and the rest of you line employees follow what I say:

SLIDE: minimum viable union
SLIDE: test-driven (employee) development
SLIDE: Not your grandmother's/grandfather's union


What I've discovered is a lot of uninformed but strongly held opinions. And FUD, Fear/Uncertainty/Doubt, worthy of 1980s-era IBM disinformation campaign.



SLIDE: competitiveness
- Personally, I would want a union that maintained the ability to re-org employees in response to market changes, and to shed dead weight. 

Rants: Unions are anti-capitalist: No they're just a market force countervailing the collusion between industrialists.



TALK with AFGE on Friday!!
